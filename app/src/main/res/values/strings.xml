Using a soft and mellow powder pink upper, Skateboard P’s newest shoes continue his ethos of boundless positivity and neverending love by featuring \"Calm\" and \"Sun\" motifs presented via tonal embroidery on the left and right feet, respectively.

The thick white Boost midsole offers comfort and style in equal measures, while a classic gum outsole finalizes the look.]]></string>
